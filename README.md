#### Our Vision: 

Track ticket sales and minimize ticket scalping, counterfeiting via Chainlink VRF and EVMOS Blockchain.

#### Project description: 
Ticket block is a web dapp that leverages  on the traceability of blockchains and unique attributes of Non-Fungible Tokens to help event organizers easily track ticket sales and minimize loss of tickets revenues due to ticket counterfeiting, scalping etc.

Ticket block users may discover, buy, sell or even resell original tickets for differentiated access NFT-gated events, dapp functionalities and communities.

Our dapp is built such that seating arrangements are assigned to tickets through Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function and also existing NFT holders may connect their wallet to get fund discounts, preferential considerations relating to health status etc.

TicketBlock is deployed to EVMOS Testnet(See our GitHub for "how to get EVMOS TestTokens).

Since May 2023, We started developing TicketBlock dapp for Theta Hackathon, OKTC hackathon and Chainlink Spring Hackathon".
